# üõ°Ô∏è Assignment: Secure Messaging with Forward Secrecy

## üìö Overview

In this assignment, you will implement a **secure messaging application** between two parties using modern cryptographic techniques inspired by protocols like **Signal** and **TLS**. Your application will support:

- **Key exchange** using ECDH
- **Authenticated encryption** using AES-GCM
- **Forward secrecy** via ephemeral key ratcheting

This assignment is designed to give you hands-on experience with practical cryptography and to deepen your understanding of secure communications protocols.

---

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By completing this assignment, you will:

- Understand the use of **Elliptic-Curve Diffie‚ÄìHellman (ECDH)** for key exchange
- Apply **HKDF** to derive symmetric session keys
- Use **AES-GCM** for authenticated encryption (confidentiality + integrity)
- Demonstrate **forward secrecy** by rotating ephemeral key material
- Document and explain the cryptographic protocol flow

---

## üì¶ Starter Code

You are provided with a skeleton Python file: `secure_chat.py`

It includes:

- Basic key generation and exchange functions
- Serialization utilities
- A minimal class-based simulation of two chat participants
- An encryption scheme using AES-GCM

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Your Tasks

### ‚úÖ 1. Understand and Complete Key Exchange

- Read and understand the `generate_ecdh_key_pair`, `derive_shared_secret`, and `hkdf_expand` functions.
- Use ECDH to securely agree on a shared secret between two parties (Alice and Bob).
- Derive a session key from the shared secret using HKDF.

### ‚úÖ 2. Implement Authenticated Encryption

- Use **AES-GCM** to encrypt and authenticate messages between parties.
- Encrypt outgoing messages with the current session key.
- Decrypt incoming messages and verify their integrity.

### ‚úÖ 3. Add Forward Secrecy

- Implement **ephemeral key rotation**:
  - After each message (or every N messages), regenerate ephemeral ECDH keys.
  - Derive a new session key from the new shared secret.
- Demonstrate in your simulation that prior session keys are no longer used once keys are rotated.

### ‚úÖ 4. Document the Protocol

Write a short (1‚Äì2 page) document or markdown file `protocol.md` including:

- A description of your protocol flow
- The cryptographic primitives used
- How forward secrecy is achieved
- A discussion of the **security goals**: confidentiality, integrity, and forward secrecy
- Limitations or assumptions (e.g., no authentication, simple in-memory simulation)

---

## üöÄ Extension (Optional Challenge)

Implement a **simple networking layer** using `socket`, `Flask`, or any async framework so that Alice and Bob can run in separate processes or machines. You could use:

- TCP sockets for raw message exchange
- Flask or FastAPI for HTTP-based message send/receive

This is optional but highly encouraged if you‚Äôre curious about real-world applications.

---

## üì§ Submission Instructions

You should submit:

1. `secure_chat.py` ‚Äì your main implementation file  
2. `protocol.md` ‚Äì your documentation of the protocol  
3. (Optional) `networking/` ‚Äì any extra files for the extended version  
4. A short transcript or screenshot of your working chat simulation (e.g., via `simulate_chat()`)

---

## üß™ Example Output

```
Session key established.

Alice sends: {"nonce": "...", "ciphertext": "..."}
Bob receives: Hello Bob!

Alice sends (new keys): {"nonce": "...", "ciphertext": "..."}
Bob receives: New key, still secure!
```
